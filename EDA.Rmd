```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
mydata<-read.csv('data.csv')
```

```{r}
summary(mydata)
```
The above is a basic summary of the data in the dataset. You'll note that 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
mydata %>%
  select(everything()) %>%  
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.))))
```
All Data in the data frame is filled in. This is a good data set for exploration
```{r}
unique(mydata$zip_code)
```
```{r}
unique(mydata$channel)
```
```{r}
unique(mydata$offer)
```
We can see in the above unique values that the categorical columns for offer, zip_code, and channel each have 3 categories each. In order to appropriately use them in any sort of regression, we will need to encode the values 1 through 3.

```{r}

```
